# History of Programming Languages

Programming languages have undergone a remarkable evolution since the inception of computing. From the rudimentary binary code to the sophisticated high-level languages of today, each stage in this journey has contributed to making software development more accessible and efficient. Let's delve into the history and development of programming languages.

## Low Level languages

### Machine Language or Binary Language
- Consists of 0s and 1s.
- Computers can only understand binary.
    - Unambiguous, simple, and easy to build.
    - Difficult for humans to read and understand.
    - Not suitable for representing complex data structures.
    - Machine-dependent due to differences in code architecture.


### Assembly Language
- Uses mnemonics like `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`.
- Operands are represented in binaries.
- Language translators (Assemblers) were built to make computers understand mnemonics.
- Assembly language is translated into machine language by an assembler.


## High Level languages

- Resemble English.
- Examples: BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, etc.
- Canâ€™t be understood by computers directly, hence language translators are needed.
  - Compiler
  - Interpreter

High-Level Languages -> Character User Interface

## Fourth Generation languages

- Aimed to have minimum input and maximum output.
- Examples: Visual Basic (VB), SQL, etc.
- Time is saved because of shorter input, but it takes more memory, 
making it less efficient than High-Level Languages.

## Fifth Generation Languages

- Designed for AI.
- Examples: LISP, PROLOG.
