| Feature            | Compiler                                                                                    | Interpreter                                                                        |

| Processing         | Converts the entire source code into object code before execution                           | Translates and executes source code line by line                                   |
| Execution Speed    | Compiled code runs faster                                                                   | Interpreted code runs slower                                                       |
| Error Handling     | Displays all errors after compilation                                                       | Displays errors of each line one by one                                            |
| Memory Requirement | Requires more memory                                                                        | Requires less memory                                                               |
| Portability        | Cannot be easily ported as it is bound to a specific target machine                         | Works well in web environments and can be easily ported                            |
| Debugging          | Difficult to debug as the program cannot be changed without getting back to the source code | Easier to debug as programs written in an interpreted language are easier to debug |
