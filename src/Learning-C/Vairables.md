# Variables in C Programming

A variable in C is a type of container that can hold a particular type of value, and its type is defined by its data type.


For example: `int x;`

Here, x is a variable of integer type, so it can hold only one integer value at a time.

Memory is allocated for a variable when it is defined, and the size of the allocation depends on the compiler. Generally, 2 bytes are allocated for an integer variable. The value that was present in those 2 bytes before assigning a value to the variable is known as a garbage value.

In C, when you assign a value to a variable, you are actually copying the value to the memory location that the variable represents.


> When you assign a value to a variable, you are essentially giving that value a name. So, when you write a = b;, you are saying "give the value that b refers to the name a".
```C
int a = 1;
int b = 2;
a = b; // This doesn't mean b is assigned to a.
```

Variables in C are memory locations that hold values. When you assign a value to a variable in C, you are actually copying the value to the memory location that the variable represents.

#### 3 basic terms related to variables

1. Definition
    1. means memory allocation. Whenever a variable is defined, memory is allocated for it.
       For example, in `int x;` 2 bytes are allocated for x.

2. Declaration
   1. Means providing information to the compiler about the data type of the variable. 
   2. For example, in `int x;`, the information is given to the compiler that the data type of x is int.

### Define and Declare

| Define | Declare | Possible                                                 |
|--------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| - [x]  | - [x]   | Obviously                                                |
| - [ ]  | - [x]   | Yes possible, you can declare without memory allocations |
| - [x]  | - [ ]   | Impossible                                               |
| - [ ]  | - [ ]   | Very nice                                                |

### Sign bit and range

- The first bit is known as the sign bit. Itâ€™s the most significant bit.
- 0 represents a positive value, and 1 represents a negative value.
- Range is determined by $2^{slots}-1$ 

C is an expanding language where byte allocation depends on the compiler. While bytes are cheap for us, C prioritizes accuracy and range at the cost of efficiency and memory.
