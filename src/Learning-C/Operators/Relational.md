# Relational

`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`

Relational operators are used to compare two values.

- associativity of relation is Left to Right

- Precedence of arithmetic is more than of Relational

```C
int a = 5, b = 2, c = 1, d;
d = c + a > b;
// (c + a) > b
// (1 + 5) > b
// 6 > 2
// for True comparisons the output will be 1.
```
