# Shorthand

## Arithmetic Shorthand Operators

The arithmetic shorthand operators allow us to combine assignment with an operation, resulting in more compact code.

These include `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, and `**=`.

For example, instead of using separate statements like `x = x + y;`, we can use `x += y`. This not only saves space but
also improves code flow by reducing redundancy.

## Bitwise Shorthand Operators

Bitwise shorthand operators enable efficient manipulation of binary data at the bit level. They consist
of `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, and `>>=`. The first three operate on bits as logical `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR` respectively,
while the latter two handle left shift and right shift operations. Here's an illustrative example:

```c
int x = 5; // 101 in binary
x &= 3; // 101 & 011 = 001
```

```C
int result = value & mask; // Perform bitwise AND
result |= new_value; // Set specific bits to 'new_value'
```

These operators help maintain code brevity when dealing with complex bit patterns.

## Conditional Compilation Shorthands

Conditional compilation shorthands simplify conditional logic by allowing inline expansion of preprocessor directives.

Two such operators are `?:` conditional operator and `#if ... #endif`.

The former performs a ternary expression, where the condition determines whether one expression or another should be
used.

On the other hand, the latter allows for conditional inclusion or exclusion of blocks of code based on defined macros.

For instance, consider the following snippet:

```c
#define DEBUG
#if defined(DEBUG)
    printf("Debugging is enabled\n");
#endif
```

Here, the `#if` directive checks if the `DEBUG` macro is defined. If so, the `printf` statement is included in the code.

These shorthands are particularly useful for managing code complexity and ensuring that only relevant code is included
in the final build.
