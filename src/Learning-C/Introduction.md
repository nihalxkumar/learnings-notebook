# Introduction to C Programming

## Overview
C is a general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency, flexibility, and close interaction with computer hardware. Originally designed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs, USA, C has become a fundamental component of modern computing, powering everything from embedded systems and operating systems to high-performance applications.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
| Advantages of C Language                            | Disadvantages of C Language                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Exceptional performance and efficiency           | - Lack of object-oriented features                            |
| - Widespread compatibility and portability         | - Limited support for avoiding namespace collisions           |
| - Low-level access and close proximity to hardware | - No garbage collector                                        |
| - Ideal for developing operating systems           | - Limited support for polymorphism                            |
| - Efficient memory management and speed            | - Limited support for exceptions                              |

## Program Structure
A program is a set of logically grouped instructions that are executed sequentially.

### Compilation Process
High-Level Code -> Compiler -> Assembly -> Assembler -> Machine Code (input/output)

### Software
Software is a collection of programs categorized into:
1. **Application Software:** Programs designed according to specific needs/utilities (e.g., Games, Antivirus, MS Office).
2. **System Software:** Essential for proper computer functioning (e.g., Operating Systems, Linkers, Loaders).

## Software Portability
C is hardware portable but not software portable.

## Compilation Steps
1. **Source Code (.c):** Written in C programming language.
2. **Object Code:** Generated by the compiler.
3. **Linking:** Object code linked with libraries by the linker (system software).
4. **Executable File:** Ready for execution.
5. **Loading:** Executable file loaded from hard disk to RAM by the loader.
